Before any terminal command for Python tasks in this workspace, run:

- `source source_me` from the project root to set PYTHONPATH and activate the local environment.

Guidelines:

- Assume `source_me` exists in the repo root; if missing, proceed normally.
- Prefer absolute project paths when invoking tools.
- Do not modify `Makefile` to achieve environment activation.
- Do not add any commentary when implementing code changes.

Assistant behavior:

- For linting, testing, docs, or Python scripts, first run `source source_me`.
- On a new terminal session, re-run `source source_me` before env-dependent commands.
- After code changes run `make lint` to check that the code adhers to ruff and mypy rules and run `make test` to check that all tests pass and that coverage is 100%.
